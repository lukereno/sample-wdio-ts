Feature: Github test
    As a Developer in Test
    I want to search for webdriverio repository
    So that I can use it in my future tests

Scenario: open URL
    Given I open the url "https://www.google.com/"
    #When  I set "abcdefghijk" to the inputfield "input[name='q']"
    #    And I set "abc" to this
    When I set "//html" to this
